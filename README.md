This project is a comprehensive implementation of a linear regression machine learning model to predict future stock prices.

So far, the linear regression model has been implemented, and I am predicting the stock prices for the common stock, NVDA (Nvidia Corp.), for the next 31 days. The code shows a small mean squared error for the linear 
regression model indicating that its predictions of historical prices were quite accurate. However, in terms of predicting future prices, the model only takes into account previous close price and 30 day moving average, 
so it is not as accurate as it can be just yet.

The Matplotlib library is being used to plot the stock prices and future predictions.
